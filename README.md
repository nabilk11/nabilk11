### Digital Marketing x Web Development Services



### Here's a Quick Q&A to Get to Know Me :-)


### 1) What is your favorite tech stack?
- I like MERN, anything JS/TS really. NEXT JS obvs. Too fyeee. Django i like working with. Do a lot of WP stuff for clients within my digital marketing agency, but I hate it.

### 2) What are you working on ? Short & Long Term.
- Doing a lot of SAAS apps, for myself and my business. Client work always, digital marketing agency, but I really dont like that kinda stuff as much. Doing some cool SEO stuff with Next. A lot of ecom stuff with Shopify - purely for getting to the gwala, the BREASHHH.
  
- Gotta work on completing projects before starting others. I have so many half-done projects in the pipeline. So many interests. And while i do eventually complete these projects (most of them lol), it doesn't have the same effect, and its not nearly as exciting to myself, or others who expected to see it done 30-90 days agos...as a whole in 2025, ###TimeManagement is going to be one of the most important areas of focus; a make or break year in my mind.  

- Some of my more explicit goals are to continue to be in better and better shape, physically and mentally, every day.

- From a tech/professional perspective, I wanna master SEO / modern JS/TS / web dev/ Integrate cool AI models / and eventually develop the many SaaS ideas i have in mind, as well as to develop financial investment apps in an effort to educate the masses and provide financial literacy to all.

- Growing up in NYC, i've had friends from every walk of life, and too often those from low income areas, aren't educated on how money works, and the many ways that the rich, stay rich, and the many opportunities we all should be taking advantage of in order to improve our financial standing. from investing in stocks and funds long term, to short term trading, and more. how to properly save your money. or even how much easier it is to make $10k more a year, than to save $10k per year. 

- Time management. Patience. Expressing myself. Trusting more ppl. Improving my body/mind/perspective every day. 

### 3) Who would you wanna collab with?
- FUTURE the rapper, @malam, my baby bro, my rich friends, my friends from highschool, carmelo anthony, rich generous ppl who are impressed by me, Tyla, Aubrey Plaza, my muses - past, n future and angel reese for an NBA son <3.

### 4) I need help with...


- everything! but i keep it to myself..lol
- censoring or filtering myself a bit more at times.
- time management.
- opening myself up to collaborating with others and being wiling to delegate more as a business owner in the midst of trying to scale..

### 5) Ask me about...
- How to invest and utilizing financial instruments like stocks / crypto. Specifically an Options trader.
- AI - Huge interest...really trying to learn as much as possible so I don't get replaced.
- Fitness - A passion, something I am good at.
- NEXT JS -> Hypebeast
- Making the best protein pancakes and staying full on a calorie deficit
