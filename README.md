### 1) What is your favorite tech stack?
- I like MERN, anything JS/TS really. NEXT JS obvs. Too fyeee. Django i like working with. Do a lot of WP stuff for clients within my digital marketing agency, but I hate it.

### 2) What are you working on ? Short & Long Term.
- Doing a lot of SAAS apps, for myself and my business. Client work always, digital marketing agency, but I really dont like that kinda stuff as much. Doing some cool SEO stuff with Next. A lot of ecom stuff with Shopify - purely for getting to the gwala, the BREASHHH.
  
- Gotta work on finishing more stuff. I have so many half-done projects in the pipeline. I wanna master SEO / modern JS / web dev/ Integrate cool AI models / and eventually develop some more financial investment apps for education, as well as "evening the playing field for people from underserved communities.
